I just finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs for the first time. I know, I know—it was released ten years ago—but back then, Steve was such a polarizing figure that I didn't feel like I could read his biography without bias. Frankly, I didn't care for him as a person (or Apple by extension)—so brash, manipulative, and boastful. Reading the book would likely have done little to change my opinion.

Now many years later, I think we all have a bit more perspective on the man and the company he co-founded. And so, almost ten years exactly since the day of Jobs' death, I picked up the book and started reading. I was surprised at how balanced it was. Isaacson did quite a good job of sticking to the facts while weaving a compelling tale of Jobs' life. It's all there—the good, the bad, and the ugly.

Jobs was quite obviously a genius when it came to understanding how technology and humans should work together.
