  Tired of getting spammed after using your email address to download an app,
  read a whitepaper, or sign up for an account you may not want to keep?
  Demailed is the answer.

I'm proud to announce the launch of a brand-new product! It's called <a href="http://demailed.com" target="_blank">Demailed</a>.

With the number of companies growing daily that request your personal information, giving away your email address is often the price of signing up for a new product or service. You often have no way of knowing whether that address will be sold to third parties, used to send unsolicited email to you, or whether its even stored in a secure fashion.

That's where Demailed comes in. Now, instead of using your real email address when registering for a new account at various sites, you can simply generate a disposable Demailed address. That generated address auto-expires after five days so marketers can no longer fill your inbox with annoying correspondence.

While you could try using a fake (i.e. non-existent) email address for such purposes, most sites require you to confirm that your email address is real before providing full access to their products. Demailed addresses exist long enough to allow these messages to get through, but then expire--thus preventing the company from continuing to email you.

Demailed is simple. The only information recorded is your real email address, and while this might seem ironic or hypocritical, it will never be used to send you unsolicited messages. That's a promise! Generate as many addresses as you need and let Demailed handle the rest. It's time to take control of your email.

Not convinced? <a href="http://demailed.com" target="_blank">Bookmark it</a> and use it next time a site asks you to register. You won't be sorry.
